            <li>4 cloves</li>

    </div>

    <div class="instructions">
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Rinse the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear.
                Soak the rice in water for about 30 minutes, then drain.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat the vegetable oil or ghee in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. 
                Add the chopped onion and saut√© until it becomes translucent and slightly golden.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the minced garlic and grated ginger to the pot and cook for another minute,
                stirring continuously.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the cumin seeds, ground coriander, turmeric powder, cinnamon stick, cardamom pods,
                cloves, and bay leaf to the pot. Stir the spices with the onion, garlic, and ginger
                mixture for about a minute, allowing the flavors to release and become fragrant. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the drained basmati rice to the pot and gently stir to coat the rice grains with 
                the spice mixture. Cook for about 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally, to lightly toast
                the rice.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour in the vegetable or chicken broth and add salt to taste. Stir gently to combine all 
                the ingredients.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and cover the pot with a 
                tight-fitting lid. Allow the rice to simmer undisturbed for about 15-20 minutes or until 
                the liquid is fully absorbed and the rice is tender.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the rice is cooked, remove the pot from the heat and let it sit, covered, for about 5 
                minutes. This helps the rice to steam and become fluffy.
            </li> 
            <li>
                Remove the lid, fluff the rice gently with a fork, and discard the cinnamon stick, cardamom pods, 
                cloves, and bay leaf.
            </li> 
            <li>
                Serve the pilau rice hot, garnished with fresh cilantro or parsley if desired. It pairs well with
                a variety of dishes such as curries, grilled meats, or vegetable stir-fries.
            </li>

        <h2>Additional Notes:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Basmati rice takes about 20 minutes to cook however, your cooking time may vary depending on the 
                type of rice you use.
            </li>
            <li>The ratio of rice to liquid is essential for perfectly cooked pilau. In this recipe, a ratio of 
                1:2 Rice:Water was used. If you prefer a softer or stickier texture, you can increase the liquid slightly.
            </li>
            <li>After the rice is cooked, let it rest for a few minutes with the lid on. This allows the rice to steam and 
                become fluffy.
            </li>
